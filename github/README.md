- Reference to markdown. Also about inline html, and so on.

- There's a online Markdown editor, where you can see, what you type. Err. I mean WYSIWYG. Sort of.
	 -> http://markdown.pioul.fr/
	that's the minimalistic one.<br>
	Again: -> https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/
	and then there's a full "Ide"
	https://stackedit.io/app
	

... Personally I don't prefer markdown.

There are some things wrong - I edit mainly within vim.

And I'd prefer having sort of the same layout within vi, <br>
as when rendered online.

E.g. linebreaks. Now I'm adding many \<br> tags. 
Which is. Not so good.

Another example: headings.
It's just the wrong direction - 
One \# should be rendered smallest
and \###### biggest.


Just now I'm checking the other possiblities.

Ok. Firstly, it works. Just add another ending then .md
A list of supported formats is at ->https://github.com/github/markup
