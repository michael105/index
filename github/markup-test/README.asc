* Obviously, not only markdown can be used.

* Markdown Cheatsheet

* Reference to markdown. Also about inline html, and so on.
	-> https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax


* There's a online Markdown editor, where you can see, what you type. Err. I mean WYSIWYG. Sort of.
	 -> http://markdown.pioul.fr/
	that's the minimalistic one.<br>
	Again: -> https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/

h3. Markdown alternatives
 
 ... Personally I don't prefer markdown.
 
There are some things wrong - I edit mainly within vim.
 
And I'd prefer having sort of the same layout within vi, <br>
as when rendered online.
 
 E.g. linebreaks. Now I'm adding many \<br> tags. 
 Which is. Not so good.
 
 Another example: headings.
It's just the wrong direction - 
One \# should be rendered smallest
and \###### biggest.
 

Just now I'm checking the other possiblities.

	Ok. Firstly, it works. Just add another ending then .md
	A list of supported formats is at ->https://github.com/github/markup

;) 

* textile Seems to be intuitive to me. (->https://www.promptworks.com/textile/writing-paragraph-text#simple-paragraphs)
  .. Im nearly convinced by textile.
	Orgmode seems to be a bit of an overkill.
	And hard to use without all these predefined keys.
	the textile guys got many things right. Like \_soething_ to be rendered kursively.
	This just feels right.
	Or the thing with the linebreaks.

	Although I admire tex and its ability for rendering,
	rendering for the web somehow has another target.
	I guess, it's the difference of the intention.

	The company behind textile looks nice as well. (>https://www.promptworks.com/)
	That's an factor to me as well. I wouldn't even want to link a company, 
	which seems to be unfriendly. ;) No. I won't even name things, I don't like.
	This would be contraproductive.
	Don't talk about things, you'd like to forget.
	This would be like talking about your ex.

	If the ex is the ex, there's been a reason. 
	Although I normally stay in contact, 
	after separation it might be the time for an upgrade.

	Finally there has been a reason.


* orgmode -  Looks good. Very good. It's more a whole organization system, based on tags.
 It's originally for emacs. But there's also a vim plugin out there
 ->https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode
 it's also an outliner, todo list, and so on..


* asciidoc - Seems like I should use this for repo's Readmes, e.g.
  Also intuitive. And might render well.

* rst. Looks also good for usual txt files.
  However, lookign at the web page, 
	it seems to me like the rendering is looking .. a bit outdated.
