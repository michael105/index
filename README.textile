h2. Overview


bc.. I'm about to sort things out.
As always, I'm used to the bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.


h3. General information written by me


"github":github 
	about shell tools (hub,git,gih) 
	and Markup

"An odd Home":https://michael105.github.io
	To be honest, it's a joke. An awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes



h3. Repos

"minilib":/michael105/minilib

bc. A tiny C system library (Ansi C subset),

	Atm, my main project in focus.
