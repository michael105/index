h2. Overview


bc.. I'm about to sort things out.
As always, I'm used to the bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.


h3. General information of me


"About github -shell and markup-":./github

"Odd sort of \"Homepage\":https://michael105.github.io
	To be honest, it's a joke. It's a awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes
