### Index


 I'm about to sort things out.
As always, I'm used to the bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.

### General information written by me

https://michael105.github.io[https://michael105.github.com - *An odd Home*]
 
 To be honest, it's a joke. An awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	What I bravoriously accomplished.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes

|    | https://github.com/michael105/et[*ET - tiny texteditor*]

The extraterrestrial editor.
Extremely tiny. 
I modified some work of others,
and added the usability of Cursor keys, 
function keys, and so on.
Mainly I did so, cause I've been really surprised
by the programming style of the original work.
Admireable.

bc. Programming in C related documents.
Amongst others, converted man pages of the BSD libc library.
I'm getting really eager on BSD, 
they are better written than the linux ones.
Yet I haven't gotten in contact with BSD.
But it's promising.
