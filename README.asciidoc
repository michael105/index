`I'm about to sort things out.
I'm used to a bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.`


### General information written by me

https://michael105.github.io[https://michael105.github.com - *An alienating Home*]
 
 To be honest, it's a joke. Featuring an awesome, ugh, I mean, awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	What I bravoriously accomplished, I guess.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes

https://github.com/michael105/et[*ET - tiny texteditor*]

 The extraterrestrial editor.
Extremely tiny. 

__I modified some work of others,
and added the usability of Cursor keys, 
function keys, and so on.
Mainly I did so, cause I've been really surprised
by the programming style of the original work.
Admirable.. ;) although not very practical. 
But that's another question...__

https://github.com/michael105/docu-c[*Doku-C*]

Programming in C related documents.
Amongst others, converted man pages of the BSD libc library.
I'm getting really eager on BSD, 
they are written better than the linux ones.
Yet I haven't gotten in contact with BSD.
But it's promising.

||  https://github.com/michael105/readkey[*readkey*]

Tiny tool for the terminal. 
12k statically linked. 
Wait for a key to be hit, with optional timeout. 
Prints the modifiers, cursor and function keys.
