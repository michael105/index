`I'm about to sort things out.
I'm used to a bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.`

 To be honest, it's a joke. Featuring an awesome, ugh, I mean, awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	What I bravoriously accomplished, I guess.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes

| https://github.com/michael105/minicore[*minicore* slimmed down core utils]

 Slim down (gnu) core utils to 64kB. (Or, maybe, 128kB..)
 A soothing puzzle in progress

 Slim version with performance and memory footprint related modifications.

__Stripped unicode support in favour of the 256 chars ASCII table
utf8 is an optional compiletime switch now
(Most programs suddenly handle German Umlauts, etc.pp out of the box, using the ASCII table only.__

https://github.com/michael105/et[*ET* - tiny texteditor]

 The extraterrestrial editor.
Extremely tiny. 

| 

__I modified some work of others,
and added the usability of Cursor keys, 
function keys, and vi-mode.
Mainly I did so, cause I've been really surprised
by the programming style of the original work.
Admirable.. ;) although not very practical. 
But that's another question...__

| https://github.com/michael105/debug.h[*debug.h*]

| wxPDF
| 

 A pdf reader, I wrote 2011/12.
At the time I needed a reader, which was able to read the huge scans of books I did. 
__(Did study Philosophy back then, absolved 2013 "Magister Artium phil.")__
This reader is not only able to read documents with several 100's of MB without problems,
it's possible to highlight (mark) positions within the document,
and have all the marks rendered to a directory, named by page and document, they are located in.

 It's one of my little bigger sized funprojects.

|
https://github.com/michael105/docu-c[*Doku-C*]
|

 Programming in C related documents.
Amongst others, converted man pages of the BSD libc library.
I'm getting really eager on BSD, 
they are written better than the linux ones.
Yet I didn't really gotten in contact with BSD. Besides (mainly) the UI of OSX.
