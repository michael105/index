`I'm about to sort things out.
I'm used to a bottom to top workflow.
So I have to start with information management.
I guess, sorting the information I put 
onto github is a good first step.`

 To be honest, it's a joke. Featuring an awesome, ugh, I mean, awful design.
	I tried to do it worse than the silliest Homepages in the nineties.
	What I bravoriously accomplished, I guess.
	Anyways, I did it, I leave it there.
	I'm still blogging there sometimes

| https://github.com/michael105/minilib[*minilib* - tiny C system lib]:

 A tiny C system library (Posix C subset), 
for building REALLY small static linked programs.     
OSX, Linux, x32, x64.  
(151 bytes for "Hellow world", statically linked with gcc)

https://github.com/michael105/st-asc[*st-asc - st clone*]

 Slim version with performance and memory footprint related modifications.

__Stripped unicode support in favour of the 256 chars ASCII table
utf8 is an optional compiletime switch now
(Most programs suddenly handle German Umlauts, etc.pp out of the box, using the ASCII table only.__

https://github.com/michael105/et[*ET - tiny texteditor*]

 The extraterrestrial editor.
Extremely tiny. 

__I modified some work of others,
and added the usability of Cursor keys, 
function keys, and vi-mode.
Mainly I did so, cause I've been really surprised
by the programming style of the original work.
Admirable.. ;) although not very practical. 
But that's another question...__ 

||  https://github.com/michael105/readkey[*readkey*]

Tiny tool for the terminal. 
12k statically linked. 
Wait for a key to be hit, with optional timeout. 
Prints the modifiers, cursor and function keys.

https://github.com/michael105/docu-c[*Doku-C*]

Programming in C related documents.
Amongst others, converted man pages of the BSD libc library.
I'm getting really eager on BSD, 
they are written better than the linux ones.
Yet I haven't gotten in contact with BSD.
But it's promising.
